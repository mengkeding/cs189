Each file goes in the order of the questions.

Running hw3_1.py will display the two dimensional grid, followed by the rotated grid
hw3_3.py will draw the isocontours for each function
digits.py will print the accuracy and write the kaggle results to results_digits.csv. The covariance visualizations are currently commented out
spam.py will print the accuracy and write the kaggle results to results_spam.csv

if pdb launches in any code, simply comment out the following line:

import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
